##  GUI Mode Tips

When using the graphical interface:

| Feature | How to Use |
|---------|------------|
| **Send messages** | Type command → Press Enter **or** click the blue send button |
| **View history** | Scroll up/down in the chat window to see past interactions |
| **Error highlighting** | Invalid commands appear in **red bubbles** for instant feedback |
| **Visual cues** | Your messages appear in soft blue bubbles (right side)<br>Nebula's replies appear in clean white bubbles (left side) |
| **Exit smoothly** | Type `bye` → Window closes automatically after showing farewell message |

>  **Cozy Background**: The interface features a warm, parchment-like background to reduce eye strain during late-night planning sessions.

---

##  Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Task number doesn't exist" | Check your task list with `list` — numbers start at **1** (not 0) |
| "Deadline must include /by" | Always use exact format: `deadline TASK /by YYYY-MM-DD` |
| Tasks disappear after restart | Ensure you see "Now you have X tasks" confirmation — tasks save automatically after every command |
| GUI shows white screen | Verify `src/main/resources/` contains:<br>- `view/MainWindow.fxml`<br>- `images/Nebula.png` and `Arthur.jpeg` |
| Date parsing errors | Use 4-digit years: `2026-02-28` (not `26-02-28`) |
